# Flight-Delay-Prediction-system
A two-stage prospective machine learning engine that, analysing data obtained between 2016 and 2017, forecasts the timely arrival and departure of flights for 15 different US airports.


When a flight arrives after the scheduled arrival time, it is said to be delayed. Environmental variables are among the primary variables influencing this delay. Passengers perceive flight delays bothersome, and airlines and nations incur excruciatingly large financial losses as a result. An essential instrument that can assist aviation authorities in efficiently reducing aircraft delays is a structured prediction system. The goal of this research is to develop a two-stage machine learning engine that can accurately forecast a flight's arrival delay in minutes after takeoff using real-time flight and weather data. A classifier first predicts whether the flight will be delayed or not, and if it will, a regression model then predicts the arrival delay in minutes.


 Installation Requirements
## Environment
It is recommended to have a Linux or macOS development environment for convenience, although the code runs on Windows 10. <br>
Use Anaconda to manage your packages and Python 3 (version >= 3.8.0 recommended). <br>
It is also recommended to run the code on <strong>Jupyter Notebook</strong>.
